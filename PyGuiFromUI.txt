There exists a bat call pyuic5.bat. This is somewhere within the python installation. It should be under PythonXX\Lib\side-packages\PyQt5\pyuic5
However in anaconda it is under Library\bin. 

pyuic5 -x some.ui -o some.py


Troubleshoot:

It might happen that some errors appear due to stuff like C:\\Program Files...
The system will interprete this as two commands due to the space between Program and Files, so it might be necessary to
place the path within the pyuic5.bat into exclamation marks --> "".
